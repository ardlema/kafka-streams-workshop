# Kafka streams workshop repo

Kafka streams development examples for a streaming workshop. The goal of this project is to provide a whole Kafka ecosystem infrastructure, a bunch of unit tests and some challenges to make easier for the workshop attendees to play around with the Kafka Streams API.

Tests will start up an embedded Kafka, Zookeeper and as a bonus track: Schema Registry! (see the Kafka Infra class to find out more).

Stay tuned! I'll be adding some challenges to improve your Kafka Streams skills
