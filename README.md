# Kafka streams workshop repo

Kafka streams development examples for a streaming workshop. The goal of this project is to provide a whole Kafka ecosystem infrastructure and a bunch of unit test to make easier for the workshop attendees to play around with the Kafka Streams API.

Tests will start up an embedded Kafka, Zookeeper and as a bonus track: Schema Registry! (see the Kafka Infra class to find out more).
